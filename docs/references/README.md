# References

This folder stores bibliographic references and supporting material used by the
project. BibTeX entries are kept in `References.bib`.

Citation naming follows the NatBib convention:
- `AuthorYear` for a single author.
- `Author1Author2Year` for two authors.
- `Author1EtAlYear` for more than two authors.

## Adding References
1. Add the BibTeX entry to `References.bib`.
2. Name any associated PDFs or notes with the same key.
3. Keep entries concise and complete (title, authors, year, venue, DOI/URL).
